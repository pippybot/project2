  <h1>These are my dogs!</h1>
  <p>I have two dogs - Loki and Bailey</p>
  
  <section>
    <h2>Loki!</h2>
    <p>This is Loki! We got him in 2021 after our black lab passed. He was a total ball of mischief, hence the name Loki. He is our dog of mischief: </p>

    <p>My mother always talks about how she doesn't like the dog, which is totally not true. You can tell with this picture of him laying on her bed.</p>

    <p>That same picture is the background of her work monitor.</p>

    <h2>Bailey!</h2>
    <p>This is Bailey! We got her last summer on a whim. She is a total goofball of a dog and barks a TON: </p>

    <p>She is the second female dog I have had in my life</p>

    <h2>Izzy!</h2>
      <p>This is Isabella, or we called her Izzy: </p>

      <p>We had Izzy for about 12 years. This past January she became sick, and overnight into the big snow storm day, she passed in her sleep.</p>
      <p>Izzy was a chihuahua weiner dog mix. We called her the 'Burnt Sausage that was left on the grill for too long'.</p>

    <h2>The Three "Dogateers"</h2>

    <p>The three of them loved spending time outside in the sun, and who doesn't, really?</p>
